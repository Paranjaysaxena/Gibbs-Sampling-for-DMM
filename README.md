# Gibbs Sampling for Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture Model
This project is a proof-of-concept implementation of the collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture model as proposed by Yin & Wang [1]. It was built as a part of the course 'Machine Learning' (CS351) at NITK, Surathkal.

## Dataset format
There are four datasets used in the project: [T.json](Datasets/T.json), [S.json](Datasets/S.json), [TS.json](Datasets/TS.json), and [Tweet.json](Datasets/Tweet.json), as obtained from [2]. Each of these files contains data in the following format.
```
{"text": "nokia lumia launch", "cluster": 48}
{"text": "ison comet century", "cluster": 98}
{"text": "impact flu pandemic", "cluster": 118}
```
